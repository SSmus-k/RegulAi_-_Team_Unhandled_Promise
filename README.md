# RegulAI

## Introduction

RegulAI is an AI-powered application that helps users manage businesses and receive structured, reliable answers to business and regulatory-related questions.

Users can create and manage their businesses in the system. For each business, RegulAI uses AI to process questions such as procedures, compliance requirements, and operational guidance, and returns clear, formatted responses instead of generic AI paragraphs.

The application is designed to ensure that AI responses are consistent, reusable, and scoped to the user’s own businesses.
