# RegulAI

## Introduction

RegulAI is an AI-powered application developed as part of a hackathon to demonstrate practical problem-solving using modern software engineering and artificial intelligence concepts. The project focuses on building a scalable, modular, and extensible system that integrates intelligent processing with a clean and functional user experience.

The primary objective of RegulAI is to showcase how AI-driven features can be combined with robust backend architecture to deliver meaningful, real-world solutions within a limited development timeframe.

This project emphasizes:
- Clean and maintainable code structure  
- Practical AI integration rather than theoretical models  
- Rapid development with a focus on usability and functionality  

RegulAI is designed to be easily extensible, allowing future improvements such as enhanced AI models, better UI interactions, API integrations, and performance optimizations.
