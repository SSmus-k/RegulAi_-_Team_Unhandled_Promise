## 🚧 Project Status: **Under Construction™**

⚠️ **Current State:** *“It runs on my machine.”*

---

### ❗ Warning

This project is **allegedly** in active development.  
Expect:

- 💥 Breaking changes  
- 🧩 Abandoned ideas  
- 🔄 Spontaneous refactors  
- 🔥 APIs that may change purely out of spite  

---

### 🤖 AI Reliability Disclaimer

The AI is currently held together by **dreams, hope, and the fragile belief that things will somehow work out**.

- ❌ No tests  
- ❌ No guarantees  

If it produces correct output, **do not ask why** —  
we will not survive that investigation.

---

### 🧠 Development Status

Development is temporarily paused because the maintainer is:

- 🧠 Mentally drained  
- 😴 Physically exhausted  
- 👻 Spiritually unavailable  

Work will resume once my brain finishes its **cooldown cycle** and stops throwing internal exceptions.

### ☠️ Final Notice

> **Clone at your own risk.**  
> Issues welcome.  
> Expectations not.
