# RegulAI

## Introduction

RegulAI is an AI-powered compliance and business intelligence application designed to help users manage businesses and interact with regulatory and procedural information in a structured and reliable way.

The application combines artificial intelligence, user-scoped business data, and a robust backend architecture to generate consistent, formatted, and context-aware responses instead of generic AI output. RegulAI focuses on making AI responses usable, auditable, and suitable for real-world systems.

The primary objective of RegulAI is to demonstrate how custom AI logic can be integrated with backend systems to automate decision support, compliance understanding, and business-related queries.

This project emphasizes:
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Practical, controlled AI integration
- Structured and reusable AI responses
- Secure user-to-business data relationships

RegulAI is designed to be extensible, allowing future improvements such as advanced AI models, better response normalization, enhanced UI interactions, and deeper regulatory integrations.

## Future Scope

While this version represents a working prototype, the project can be further enhanced by:
- Improving AI accuracy and response consistency
- Adding stronger validation and audit logging
- Enhancing UI/UX for better usability
- Introducing testing, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines
- Expanding regulatory rule engines and integrations
